New tool: glue_logos [--draw_both_strands] <output_logo>
with stdin:
pwm1 direct shift1
pwm2 revcomp shift2
pwm3 direct shift3
...

in order to be able to pipeline with macroape's align_motifs:
align_motifs <pcm1> <pcm2> <pcm3> | glue_logos <output_logo>




Fix issue: generate_all_logos fails when runned with current folder as input folder and output folder inside it: it tries to process folders in input_folder as other files and fails on folder logo (or any other file)

AssetsPath shouldn't be used at draw_logo level because it makes it impossible to change scheme on one folder that is outside the gem
And how to make possible use schemes inside the assets path
